GRAMODAY PROBLEM STATEMENT

open folder in vs code editor.
For testing this project first do npm install for downloading all dependencies.
after that start local mongodb database server using mongod in one tab of a terminal and then in another tab do nodemon index.js for running local web server.
after that open test.http file for testing post and get request. As you open the file i have written the request code for both post and get request. You have to just click on send request.
You can also test post and get request using postman.
